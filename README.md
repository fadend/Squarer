# Remove perspectival distortion from an image

If a rectangular object like a sign wasn't exactly dead on when you took a photo of it,
it will be distorted.

This apps let you "square up" that rectangle, undo-ing the perspectival projection.

This follows the code example from "Geometry for Programmers" by Oleksandr Kaleniuk,
